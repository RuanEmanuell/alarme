## Todo

A Simple Todo List made in Flutter for training the usage of Provider instead of SetState(), which I was much more used to.

### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository folder of your Flutter project.
